Pygr README
===========

Introduction
------------

Pygr is an open source software project used to develop graph database 
interfaces for the popular Python language, with a strong emphasis 
on bioinformatics applications ranging from genome-wide analysis of 
alternative splicing patterns, to comparative genomics queries of 
multi-genome alignment data.

Latest Release
--------------

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pygr/

Documentation
-------------

doc/index.html is a good place to start.

Core Prerequisites
-----------------

1) Python >= 2.1 

Apps Prerequiites
-----------------
	
MySQL-python >= 1.2.0
MySQL >= 3.23.x  

Note: While pygr's core functionality is solely dependent on a sane python environment, the aformentioned apps requirements must be installed if one wishes to utilize the apps modules and test code. 

Supported Platforms
-------------------

In theory, pygr should work on any platform that adequately supports python.

Here are the OS's we've successfully tested on:

o Linux 2.2.x/2.4.x
o OS X 
o OpenBSD
o Windows XP

Installation
------------

Installing pygr is quite simple. 

1) tar -xzvf pygr-1.0.tar.gz 
2) cd pygr-1.0/
3) python setup.py install 

Once the test framework has completed successfully, the setup script
will install pygr into python's respective site-packages directory. 

Using Pygr
----------

Pygr has a myriad of applications, however, providing a comprehensive 
description of its utility is out of the scope of this document (see
Documentation). 

If you wish to test your install using the provided test scripts, 
or simply want to give pygr an initial whirl, follow these steps:

1) Flesh out ~/.my.cnf, like so:

------- cut here -------
[client]
socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
user = zach
password = seaurchin007!
------ cut here -------

2) cd pygr/tests/ 
3) mysql < HUMAN_SPLICE_03
4) python test.py
